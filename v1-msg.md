this is the check point for this project as v1
current aihelp terminal proj consist of
1. json chat management - well probably not a good idea to put that in config idk ..
2. most ai from gemini and useful once from open oruter (2025-04-16 12:15)
-- tho OR models not have checked for testing . should work tho 
3. json chat msg contains intial chated model name 
4. markdown via bat md 
5. system promt for working with md and copy sh 
6. copy sh to get the code blocks and copy using 1- .. number 
7. uses .env for api 
8. uses fzf bat jq and no db (json) and xclip/wl-copy 

-- comment - some dumb models doesnt understand / read the system prompt properly . so maybe 2ble prompting is needed to get the expected answer 

todo:
@ check OR models
@ add more api providors?
